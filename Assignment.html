    <h1>Tribute To My Father. </h1>
        <p>Born of a small village in Vihiga back Western Kenya he was the Third child to my Grandparents.Though Born in
        poverty he was quite hard-working even in his early years. As I was told, he helped out his mother every  morning
        transporting pots to the nearest market about 10 kilometres away before going to school. He studied at a small
        Primary school nearby known as Enanga Primary school he performed well with the little resources he had at his
        disposal which at the end of his primary school education he earned his place at Chavakali high school. This
        brought him a break as he could now completely focus on his studies without any outside interruptions.<br>
        </p>

        <p>Though all the hardships he faced in his earlier years he persevered through the six years of secondary
        school and passed so well that it earned him the opportunity to study Bachelors of Medicine and Surgery at
        The University Of Nairobi.After his six-year bachelors course he decided to specialize in Radiology which he
        undertook its Maters programme at the same university.I don't know how long he took in his Master's Degree but I
        can vividly remember attending his graduation back in 2010 when I was 7 years old. He is one of the best fathers
        as I know he strives to provide for his children, me included, as he never wanted us to lack in anything,
        especially considering his childhood. My father is the rock to our family as we look to him for support. He
        encourages us to focus on our passions and I look up to him although having a strained relationship in  the
        past.<br></p>

        <p>He has made a lot of achievements in his life and is still continuing achieving more. Back in 2012, together
        with his friend, they opened a small clinic specializing majorly in medical scanning and it is still active upto
        today. He is the among the few in his own family who has bought his own plot of land and building his own
        house.My father has ensured that every one of his children acquires good quality education from reputable
        schools. He never fails to provide for his family and is also kind.<br></p>

        <p>I admire my father's sense of hard-work and duty he shows towards his family. Though he may have his failings
        as a human he still gets up from them and shows us to never give up and that people, no matter how crooked they
        are as a person is they have the capacity to change. I truly have learnt a lot from him and his life and I still
        continue learning more as he continues his endeavours in his life.<br> </p>
